# Pets App


This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs. 
I learned to build this app in a Udacity course ([Android Basics: Data Storage]
(https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845)). 

In this course, I learned about the importance of data persistence when building an Android app. 
I was introduced to the fundamentals of SQL, the programming language needed to interact with an 
SQLite relational database. SQLite is a commonly used method to store large sets of data locally on an
Android device. 
I also learned how to work with Content Providers, which help my data storage to be 
bug free and to be shared with other apps.
